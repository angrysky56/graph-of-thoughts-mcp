# Graph of Thoughts MCP Server üß†

A sophisticated Model Context Protocol server that provides **Graph of Thoughts reasoning frameworks** for complex problem-solving through structured reasoning methodologies.

Based on the research from "Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models" (Besta et al., AAAI 2024).

## üåü Features

- **Reasoning Framework Provider**: Provides structured guidance for Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, Graph-of-Thoughts, and Iterative Refinement patterns
- **Meta-Cognitive Guidance**: Built-in quality assessment and improvement recommendations
- **Pattern Templates**: Ready-to-use templates for different reasoning approaches
- **Comparative Analysis**: Framework for comparing different reasoning methodologies
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless integration with Claude Desktop as a reasoning assistant
- **Zero Circular Dependencies**: Clean architecture that helps Claude reason better rather than attempting reasoning itself

## üöÄ Quick Start
Just add the adapted config to your client:

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add the configuration from `example_mcp_config.json` to your Claude Desktop config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graph-of-thoughts": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/your-path-to/graph-of-thoughts-mcp/graph_of_thoughts_mcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage

Restart Claude Desktop and access the sophisticated reasoning tools:

## üõ† Available MCP Tools

- **Strengths**: Explores alternatives while maintaining quality
- **Use Case**: Decision-making with multiple viable options

### Graph of Thoughts
- **Best for**: Complex problems requiring synthesis of multiple perspectives
- **Operations**: Generate(4) ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Select(3) ‚Üí Aggregate ‚Üí Generate(2) ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Select(1)
- **Strengths**: Rich interaction between ideas, comprehensive exploration
- **Use Case**: Complex strategic planning, research synthesis

### Iterative Refinement
- **Best for**: Problems requiring progressive optimization
- **Operations**: Generate ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Generate(improvements) ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Select ‚Üí Refine
- **Strengths**: Continuous improvement, builds on insights
- **Use Case**: Creative writing, solution optimization

## üéØ Advanced Usage Examples

### Complex Strategy Analysis
```
Execute graph reasoning on: "Develop a comprehensive AI governance framework for a multinational corporation considering regulatory compliance, ethical implications, competitive advantage, and stakeholder concerns" using the "graph_of_thoughts" pattern.
```

### Custom Pattern for Research
```
Create a custom reasoning pattern called "research_synthesis" for "academic_research" problems using operations: ["generate", "generate", "score", "select", "aggregate", "generate", "score"].
```

### Quality Assessment
```
Analyze the quality of the previous reasoning result focusing on logical consistency, evidence integration, and practical applicability.
```

## üèó Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated architecture inspired by the ETH Zurich Graph of Thoughts research:

- **Operations System**: Core reasoning building blocks (Generate, Score, Aggregate, Select)
- **Controller Pattern**: Manages execution flow and coordinates operations
- **Graph Builder**: Fluent interface for constructing reasoning workflows
- **MCP Integration**: Seamless Claude Desktop integration through sampling
- **Quality Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation and improvement frameworks

## üî¨ Research Foundation

This implementation is based on "Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models" (Besta et al., AAAI 2024), which demonstrated significant improvements over Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thoughts approaches on complex reasoning tasks.

The key insight is that reasoning benefits from both structured exploration and rich interconnections between ideas, enabling more sophisticated problem-solving capabilities than traditional linear or tree-based approaches.

- `got://methodology-guide`: Comprehensive methodology guide (accessible as MCP resource)
- **Original Paper**: [Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09687.pdf)
- **ETH Zurich Repository**: [Official Implementation](https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts)

## üõ° Error Handling

The system follows transparent error handling principles:
- All errors are properly displayed with clear, actionable messages
- No fallback systems that mask underlying issues
- Comprehensive logging to stderr for MCP compatibility
- Graceful degradation with informative error responses

## üö® Performance Notes

- Optimized for sophisticated reasoning over speed
- Graph-of-Thoughts patterns are computationally intensive but provide superior results for complex problems
- Use Chain-of-Thought for simple problems requiring fast responses
- Quality scoring uses LLM evaluation for accuracy but can be customized with scoring functions
